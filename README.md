This is was an enlightening experience.  I have __A LOT__ to learn about RxSwift.
I may have taken the prompt too literally.  There are many terms and versions including: "Reactive," RxSwift, Combine, Async/Await...

I could have complete the entire list using UIKit and delegates/coordinators; but, I was unable to build a feature-complete app with RxSwift.
I spent the entire time fighting the RxSwift architecture.


This is a "working" app (tested on an iPhone X device); the code is an orgnaized, mostly dependency-infected, un-unit-tested mixup of architecture.

I have many questions about RxSwift, how to use it properly, and it's future given that Apple is moving ahead with Combine as SwiftUI matures.  I would like to discuss it with you.

Also, _if you could direct me to a repo with a _good_ example of a solution to this challenge I would be grateful.__ I need working code to learn from.  There are many missing topics in searchable online forums.  If you have any recommendation for good and up-to-date learning materials, I would appreciate that, as well.

Thank you for this opportunity.  I learned a great deal.
